# {{$frontmatter.title}}

A `receipt.json` file is outputted after each deployment and contains
non-sensitive information about the deployment. The main use of a receipt file
is to remove an Airnode deployment when no longer needed. See the
[Airnode Removal documentation](/reference/airnode/next/packages/deployer.md)
for usage and commands.

It also provides the Airnode xpub for the hardened derivation path
`m/44'/60'/0'` that must be announced off-chain in order for sponsors to derive
their designated sponsor wallet. This wallet will then be used by the Airnode to
fulfill each request made by the requester contracts.

- `airnodeWallet`: address and xpub information
- `deployment`: Airnode configuration and timestamp of deployment
- `success`: specifies whether the deployment was successful or not

A `receipt.json` file is created for both a AWS or GCP deployment. A receipt is
not generated for client deployments (deploying to a Docker container).
